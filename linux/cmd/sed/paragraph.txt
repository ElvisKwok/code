The substitute command is applied to the lines matching the address. If no
address is specified, it is applied to all lines that match the pattern, a
regular expression. If a regular expression is supplied as an address, and no
pattern is specified, the substitute command matches what is matched by the
address.  This can be useful when the substitute command is one of multiple
commands applied at the same address. For an example, see the section "Checking
Out Reference Pages" later in this chapter.
